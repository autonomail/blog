Autonomail is progressing nicely. As you can see, we recently re-designed and updated our website. In doing so began (and still are) developing a [new web framework](http://waigojs.com) that will enable us to build a secure, scalable, high performance product. 

Autonomail is now HTTPS only with [Perfect Forward Secrecy](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/08/pushing-perfect-forward-secrecy-important-web-privacy-protection) turned on. This is now the default setting for all of Autonomail's servers. If you dig into the details of our [SSL setup](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=autonomail.com) we've almost got the top score. There are a couple of minor items that still need fixing...we're working on then.

Since we announced our product there have been couple of other services that have come to the fore with similar offerings - e.g. [whiteout](https://whiteout.io/). It's good to see more and more people waking up to the importance of encrypted email and the privacy implications of electronic communication in general. 

We are still aiming for a mid-2014 release of our beta product and an even-sooner first look at our email client. Stay tuned!
