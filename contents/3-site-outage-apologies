We would like to apologize for the site being down for a few days. We have (obviously) now restored service and also 
enabled [real-time monitoring](http://www.siteuptime.com/) so that we'll be able to deal with issues much sooner in future.

As to what happened....this site is currently deployed using [Docker](http://docker.io/), 
a fantastic system for packaging websites, services and other things you might want to run on 
a server into easily deployable _containers_, similar to show shipping containers are used throughout the world to transport 
items, regardless of the type of item being transported or the size or shape of the vehicle doing the transporting. Docker 
does something similar for server-hosted software. But it's a very new technology (pre version 1.0) and has still it's 
fair share of [quirks and bugs](https://github.com/dotcloud/docker/issues/1063). We're getting to grips with it and learning as we go along (as are most users of Docker). The 
Docker container running the autonomail.com site had for some reason stopped running and this is why the site was down. The 
logs don't reveal any errors and neither was our server rebooted at any point, so at the moment we can only guess as to 
what happened.

For now we're going to closely monitor the situation. If Docker proves to be unreliable then we will revert to a non-Docker 
server setup.
