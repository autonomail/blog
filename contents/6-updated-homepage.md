{{{ "title": "Updated homepage and documentation, skipping beta", "tags": ["website"], "category": "website", "date": "06-25-2014" }}}

We have simplified our homepage. We have also added an [FAQ](/faq) and updated our [documentation](/docs). Be sure to check out our updated guides to [encrytion](/docs/security/email-encryption), how we [handle passwords](/docs/security/passwords) as well as some general guidelines on [protecting your privacy](/docs/security/privacy).

We have also decided not to have a beta launch anymore and instead just go for the real one. This extra work does mean our service will not be available mid-2014 as previously stated. However we still aim to launch later on in the year, and when we do we hope you'll agree it was worth the extra wait!
